# data_dir

`data_dir` is the host machine directory to serve as the TeamCity Data Directory
where TeamCity stores project settings and build results. Pass an empty
 directory for the brand new start. If the mapping is not set, you will
lose all the TeamCity settings on the container shutdown.
